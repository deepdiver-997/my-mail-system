This is a mail system based on c++, using boost as network layer and qt for ui development, which ensure cross-platform. Until I created the repository, the whole logic of the back had been built, the front was totally written by ai, and I didn't understand it yet. Hoping this project would help those who want to use c/c++ finishing their practical training in software development but can't get enough docs or examples.
